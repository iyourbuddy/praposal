    <h1>✨ A Heartfelt Proposal ✨</h1>
    <div class="slider">
        <div class="slide active"><b>✨ Assalamu Alaikum ✨🌙</b><br>
            I hope you are doing well. This message is from someone who has held sincere feelings for you for a long time 💖. Out of respect and to avoid any discomfort, I prefer to stay anonymous for now 🤲. However, my intention is purely for Nikah 💍, not for anything impermissible 🚫.</div>
        <div class="slide"><b>Allow me to introduce myself.</b><br>I am a man of ghairat (honor) and haya (modesty), raised in a well-respected family that values integrity and sincerity. I have always been dedicated to my academics and skills—this very proposal stands as proof of my intentions and character. Alhamdulillah, I stay away from bad habits and strive to follow the right path in all aspects of life.
            <p class="verse">"And whoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose." ✨
                (Surah At-Talaq 65:3)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide"><b>Our families know each other well 🤝</b>, and this makes it even more important for me to approach this matter with sincerity and respect. You have been a part of my prayers 🤲 for a long time. If you are not already committed to someone else and are open to this, I would like to send a formal proposal to your father 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. I want to follow the right path and avoid any haram interactions before marriage ❌📱.</div>
        <div class="slide">🌹 I have always admired your haya (modesty), the way you carry yourself with dignity and grace. Your eyes ✨—full of depth and purity— reflect the sincerity of your soul. Beauty is not just in the face, but in character, and yours speaks for itself. The way you respect and love your family, especially your mother, shows the kind of person you are. A woman raised by a noble mother carries that nobility within her.
            <p class="verse">"Women of purity are for men of purity, and men of purity are for women of purity." ✨
                (Surah An-Nur 24:26)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="slide"><b>There is no rush for marriage ⏳</b>— I fully respect your comfort and timing ⏰. If you are open to this but want to take time, I am completely okay with that 🤍. We will proceed only when you are ready 😊...</div>
        <div class="slide">If everything goes well, and I am sure this is moving in the right direction, I will open up my identity 🆔 if you wish. I just want to make sure everything is aligned before revealing myself to avoid any awkwardness in our family gatherings 🤲.</div>
        <div class="slide">Please take your time to think about it 🤍. If you are open to this, let me know, and we can proceed in the most respectful and proper manner 💌. If not, I completely understand and will respect your decision without any pressure 🙏.
            <i>(Though I truly hope you decide to say yes to a righteous, tall, fair, and fit boy (me) (not being self-obsessed—just a reality 😉) rather than ending up with an uncle with a belly, twice your age! 😅)</i>
        </div>
        <div class="slide">No matter what, I trust in Allah’s plan, as He is the best of planners:
            <p class="verse">"But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners." ☝️
                (Surah Al-Anfal 8:30)</p>
                May Allah (SWT) guide us both to what is best 🤲💞.
